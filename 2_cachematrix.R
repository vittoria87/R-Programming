## `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## `cacheSolve` computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix`. If the inverse has
##  already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the `cachesolve` retrieves the inverse from the cache.

## This function creates a special 'matrix' object that can cache its inverse.
